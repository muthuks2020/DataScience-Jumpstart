# DataScience-Jumpstart


Sample code to jump start Data Science projects. Not meant to replace the good old docs -
just samples to get started quick  easy.

Why this repository exists?
I find it handy to keep a quick and easy bootstrap code for my ad-hoc analysis on github. 
Anytime i need to try a few algorithms on a data set - i simply replace a few lines and just 
visualize the data using off-the-shelf algos and it helps me figure out how much time & effort
its going to take to work on a particular data-set.

How do I run it?
I have dumped sample files in each folder
